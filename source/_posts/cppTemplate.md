Hi there everyone, recently I was solving some problems when I encountered for a need to have a standard template for solving my problems. We all need ```iostream``` and some ```typedef``` statements for getting I/O and minimizing the time taken to write ```unsigned long long int``` üòù. And moreover, its much more important in a short contest to focus on your problem rather than , say importing a ton of libraries and writing some helper functions which you use frequently.

Well, if you use sublime text, and didn't know, how to make custom snippets, lets get throught it, and in case you know already, there's no harm in skipping this post üòâ.

+ Lets do this step by step! Go to the **Tools** menu and inside the **Developer** sub menu, select **New Snippet...**

+ Then we can easily setup a template code like the image below:

+ You can see I have setup source.c++, because I do not want that c++ source code whenever I type **code**(the shortname for our snippet) and press tab in , say, Python.

**Note** : Now,we have made a template, save it by any name having extension as **.sublime-snippet**

Hope this helps further! Hop on to comments for hugs and bugs!
