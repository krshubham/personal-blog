Hi there, its been long since [init-1](https://krshubham.github.io/blog/2017/04/21/init-1/) üôÇ. Since I was quite busy with my academics, projects and other such stuff. Though one my class assignments involved building a peer to peer file sharing system like napster. I would love to talk about it in a separate blog post. For Now, I want to tell you all an awesome news! I got **selected** in **Google Summer of Code** 2017 under the organisation [Berkman Klein Center, Harvard University](https://cyber.harvard.edu/). The project I will be working on is **Teem**, which is an online tool for decentralized collaboration which is based on the idea of commons based peer production!

### The project
Its too early to say about the final project that will come out because, I am still in the community bonding period! I will still improve my proposal syncing everything with my mentor. I will update here, once I am done with it!

I am having my exams these days, so I'll go and study for now! Hope you guys have an awesome time!

Cheers! ü§òüèª
