Hi there everyone, this post about Google Foobar and how I was able to land at this page. Stay tuned and read to know how it all happened!

When Google showed there ICC world cup doodle inside the inspect element section, there was a comment which said,

```html
<!-- Wanna play a game ? Find more at: (some link) -->
```
So I pasted that link on my browser and to my surprise it really worked! I was able to login to foobar and saw that there are 5 levels to clear. Level 1 pretty easy, level 2 had 2 questions and level 3 was tough and I was stuck on it. It required the knowledge of **Absorbing Markov Chains** which I was not able to read in my busy schedule and due to which the time limit expired. But, nevertheless, I got this great opportunity to have a look at foobar myself! It really feels great! And btw here are some screenshots üòÅ:
